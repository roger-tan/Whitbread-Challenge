# Approch 

- First, I tried to understand the Foursquare API by reading the documentation
- Second, I generated the models by using this [tool](https://github.com/insanoid/SwiftyJSONAccelerator)
- Third, I decided to use Moya because Moya simplified all http request. Explaination can be find [here](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/blob/master/Readme.md)
- After that, I decided to create the provider and try to get a response from Foursquare API without to use the current location of user
- When the request works. I converted all the response into models by using SwiftyJSON and models generated by SwiftJSONAccelerator
- Then, I decided to use a tableView to display the result
- When the result is displayed, I started to implement the CLLocationManager to get the current location of user.
- After that, when I was sure that the location update works, I started to change the parameter of the provider to get a venues with the location of users.
